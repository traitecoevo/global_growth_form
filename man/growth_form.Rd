\usage{
growth_form(version = NULL)

growth_form_versions(local = TRUE, path = NULL)

growth_form_version_current_local(type = "local", local = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{Version number.  The default will load the most
recent version on your computer or the most recent version known
to the package if you have never downloaded the data before.
With \code{growth_form_del}, specifying \code{version=NULL}
will delete \emph{all} data sets.}

\item{type}{Type of version to return: options are "local"
(versions installed locally) or "github" (versions available on
github).  With any luck, "github" is a superset of "local".  For
\code{growth_form_version_current}, if "local" is given, but there
are no local versions, then we do check for the most recent
github version.}
